# Ruby-Bubble-Sort

> In this project we manage to create two methods that sort an array of numbers and strings.

## Built With
- Ruby
- Rubocop
- Git

## How to run it
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.
* If you're using latest version of git.
* Clone this url https://github.com/Milypm/Ruby-Bubble-Sort/tree/main on your local host.
* Un zip and open the folder that contains the file and run the command line 
--> irb
irb(main):001:0> require './bubble_sort'
Hopefully you will get a => true
*Then you can try the first method called bubble_sort([9,8,7,6,5,4])
-In this example you will get the sorted array [4,5,6,7,8,9]
*To try the second method use bubble_sort_by(["helloxxx3" "helloxx2" "hellox1" "hello"]) do |left, right| end
-In this example you will get the sorted array => ["hello", "hellox1", "helloxx2", "helloxxx3"]
